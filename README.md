## Description
<p>This project is based on https://github.com/patrickhoey/BludBourne using LibGDX library.<br>
It is an RPG 2D base game.</p>

#### Map
<p>The maps are from the Sword of Mana game (GBA) and influenced by the seiken densetsu serie. <br>
The edition was made with Tiled.exe in order to build layers.
</p>

#### Entities
- The hero is an animated 2D sprite. <br>
The hero moves freely in the maps with the arrow keys or with "WASD". <br>
The hero will soon be able to interact with NPCs with the "E" key.
- NPCs are also animated 2D sprites. <br>
You can interact with them by clicking on them at a proper distance. Some have conversations and quests.

#### Battle Screen
The battle system is a turn based fight. <br>
The screen displays the amount of damage taken and inflicted by the player. <br>
For now, you can do a basic attack and use objects to restore your health and magic. Later you will be able to choose between a various set of attacks. <br>

#### Option Screen
The option screen is divided into 3 buttons : <br>
- The music settings (music is ok / sound is not implemented yet) <br>
- The control settings <br>
- A back input, so we can return to the previous screen <br>

The option screen is triggered on the "O" key.

#### Inventory
The inventory can be displayed through the chest icon on the status UI. <br>
You can drag and drop items and use consumables by double-clicking on them.

#### Level Up
When you level up (battle, quest), you will be able to display some more extra points to your base stats. <br>

#### Profiles
The game is saved automatically when a specific action is down (change map, get quest, ...). <br>
You can chose to start a new game or load an existing profile on the menu screen.

#### Class system
Base class can evolve if you meet the requirements. Each class can upgrade into 2 different classes, which themselves give 2 possible classes <br>
Upgrading class will grant you different bonuses, from bonus on character stats to weapons stats. <br>
Example of the class tree system for the warrior :

```mermaid
graph TD;
    WARRIOR-->KNIGHT;
    WARRIOR-->GLADIATOR;
    KNIGHT-->PALADIN;
    KNIGHT-->WARLORD;
    GLADIATOR-->DUELIST;
    GLADIATOR-->WEAPON_MASTER;
```

## Bugs

- Objects in inventory are stacking even if there are not the same
- FadeIn effect not working when transition [menu &#8594; game]
- Drag and drop selection issue on item's render (items are far from mouse when picking them)
- Sometimes current hp/mp on status HUD add a blank space before the max player's hp/mp

&#8855; _Reset position when exiting the game is not properly set when you close the game with the X window button (it is fine when exiting with the ESCAPE key)_

-------
## To improve

- More transition effect
- Z sorting
- Improve collision with Box2D
- Animations on map (opening doors, water, ...)
